Create a collage of 12 realistic customer testimonial-style photos featuring the same navy blue rhinestone bodycon mini dress with gold crystal accents. These should look like REAL customer photos taken on smartphones, NOT professional product photography.

DRESS DETAILS TO INCLUDE IN EVERY IMAGE:
- Navy/dark blue color with rhinestone/crystal embellishments
- Gold and bronze rhinestone swirl patterns throughout
- Form-fitting bodycon silhouette
- Square neckline with spaghetti straps
- Mini length with thigh-high slit
- Glamorous sparkly party dress aesthetic

IMAGE VARIETY REQUIREMENTS (12 different scenarios):

1. Club/Nightclub Mirror Selfie - Woman taking bathroom mirror selfie in club setting, dim lighting with flash
2. Full Body Party Photo - Friend taking photo at house party, casual indoor lighting
3. Wedding Guest Outdoor - Daytime wedding guest photo, natural sunlight, outdoor venue background
4. Girls Night Out Group Photo - 3-4 women together at bar/club, one wearing the dress
5. Date Night Restaurant Selfie - Couple selfie at nice restaurant, dim ambient lighting
6. Dressing Room Try-On Mirror - Store dressing room mirror selfie, fluorescent lighting
7. Pre-Party Getting Ready - Bedroom mirror selfie, getting ready for night out
8. Club Dance Floor Candid - Action shot on dance floor, colorful club lights
9. Rooftop/Outdoor Event - Rooftop bar, city skyline or string lights background, golden hour
10. Hotel Room Before Event - Hotel mirror full-length selfie, good lighting
11. Birthday Party Celebration - Woman in dress at birthday party, balloons in background, candid smile
12. Concert/Festival Photo - Woman in dress at outdoor concert, stage lights visible, fun moment

CRITICAL AUTHENTICITY ELEMENTS:
- Smartphone camera quality (iPhone/Android), NOT professional DSLR
- Natural grain, slight blur, realistic phone camera artifacts
- Varied angles - some slightly off-center, not perfectly composed
- Different times of day and lighting conditions
- Mix of flash and no-flash photos
- Real backgrounds - clubs, homes, restaurants, venues (not studios)
- Diverse women - different ethnicities (Latina, Black, White, Asian, Middle Eastern), ages 21-35, body types
- Natural expressions - genuine smiles, confidence, having fun
- Casual accessories - phones, drinks, clutches visible when appropriate
- Slight imperfections - realistic makeup, natural poses, authentic moments

COLLAGE LAYOUT:
- Arrange in a 3x4 grid layout (3 columns, 4 rows)
- Leave clear white borders between images for easy cropping
- Each image should be distinct and clearly separated
- Square or rectangular format that works well for cropping individual images

STYLE REFERENCE:
Think: Real customer Instagram posts, tagged photos on social media, authentic testimonial submissions, NOT polished influencer content or professional product photography.

AVOID:
- Studio backgrounds or professional lighting setups
- Overly perfect composition or poses
- Professional model looks (too polished)
- All photos looking too similar
- Any images that scream "AI generated"

GOAL: Create images that could be mistaken for real customer submissions on a fashion brand's Instagram or website testimonials section.
