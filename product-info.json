      "question": "What size should I order?",
      "answer": "This dress runs true to size and features stretchy fabric for a comfortable, forgiving fit. We recommend ordering your usual size—the bodycon design is meant to hug your curves while the stretch ensures you can move and dance freely. If you're between sizes or prefer a slightly looser fit, size up. Check our size guide tab for detailed measurements to find your perfect fit."

    {
      "question": "How long does shipping take?",
      "answer": "Standard shipping takes 5-7 business days within the US. Need it faster? Expedited shipping options are available at checkout for 2-3 day delivery. All orders are processed within 1 business day, and you'll receive tracking information as soon as your dress ships. Planning for a specific event? Order at least 2 weeks in advance to ensure arrival with time to spare."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your return policy?",
      "answer": "We offer a 30-day return policy from the date of delivery. If the dress doesn't fit or isn't quite what you expected, you can return it for a full refund (minus original shipping costs). Items must be unworn, unwashed, and in original condition with tags attached. See our Returns tab for complete details and instructions on how to start a return."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I care for the rhinestones?",
      "answer": "Hand wash cold in gentle detergent, inside out, to protect the rhinestones. Never machine wash or put in the dryer—hang or lay flat to air dry. The rhinestones are securely attached, but gentle care will keep them sparkling for years. Avoid harsh chemicals, bleach, or fabric softeners. Store hanging or folded carefully to prevent snagging. A quick steam (not direct iron) can refresh the fabric if needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What material is it made of?",
      "answer": "This dress features high-quality stretch fabric (polyester blend with spandex) that hugs your curves while staying comfortable all night. The gold crystal rhinestones are individually applied to create the stunning starburst pattern throughout the dress. The fabric has just the right amount of stretch for a flattering bodycon fit that doesn't feel restrictive when you're dancing or sitting."
    },
    {
      "question": "What bra should I wear with this?",
      "answer": "The square neckline and spaghetti straps look best with a strapless bra or adhesive cups/pasties. Many customers go braless since the bodycon fit provides support, but it depends on your comfort level. If you need more support, try a nude or black strapless bra, or use fashion tape to secure adhesive cups. Avoid regular bra straps—they'll show and distract from the clean lines of the neckline."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do the rhinestones fall off?",
      "answer": "Nope! Each rhinestone is securely attached to withstand normal wear and dancing. We quality-check every dress before shipping to ensure all embellishments are firmly in place. With proper care (hand washing inside out, air drying), your rhinestones will stay put through many nights out. If you do notice any loose stones before wearing, a tiny drop of fabric glue will secure them—but this is extremely rare."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where can I wear this?",
      "answer": "Literally anywhere you want to make an entrance! This dress is perfect for nightclubs, bachelorette parties, birthday celebrations, New Year's Eve parties, Vegas trips, girls' nights out, cocktail parties, formal events, or any occasion where you want to sparkle and stand out. The navy blue and gold combo is versatile enough for both winter and summer events. Basically, if there's dancing, drinks, or photos involved, this dress belongs there."
