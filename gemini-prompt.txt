DETAILED GEMINI PROMPT FOR TESTIMONIAL IMAGES:

Create a collage of 10 realistic customer testimonial-style photos featuring the same navy blue rhinestone bodycon mini dress with gold crystal accents. These should look like REAL customer photos taken on smartphones, NOT professional product photography.

DRESS DETAILS TO INCLUDE IN EVERY IMAGE:
- Navy/dark blue color with rhinestone/crystal embellishments
- Gold and bronze rhinestone swirl patterns throughout
- Form-fitting bodycon silhouette
- Square neckline with spaghetti straps
- Mini length with thigh-high slit
- Glamorous sparkly party dress aesthetic

IMAGE VARIETY REQUIREMENTS (10 different scenarios):

1. **Club/Nightclub Mirror Selfie** - Woman taking bathroom mirror selfie in club setting, dim lighting with flash, holding phone, slight motion blur, authentic pose

2. **Full Body Party Photo** - Friend taking photo at house party, casual indoor lighting, woman posing with drink in hand, warm home lighting, candid smile

3. **Wedding Guest Outdoor** - Daytime wedding guest photo, natural sunlight, outdoor venue background, posed but natural, professional-ish but still smartphone quality

4. **Girls Night Out Group Photo** - 3-4 women together at bar/club, one wearing the dress, group selfie angle, club lighting, genuine laughter

5. **Date Night Restaurant Selfie** - Couple selfie at nice restaurant, dim ambient lighting, woman in dress sitting at table, romantic setting

6. **Dressing Room Try-On Mirror** - Store dressing room mirror selfie, fluorescent lighting, showing price tag still on, excited expression, typical fitting room background

7. **Pre-Party Getting Ready** - Bedroom mirror selfie, getting ready for night out, makeup visible on vanity, soft bedroom lighting, excited energy

8. **Club Dance Floor Candid** - Action shot on dance floor, colorful club lights, slight motion, friends in background, genuine fun moment, taken by friend

9. **Rooftop/Outdoor Event** - Rooftop bar or outdoor evening event, city skyline or string lights in background, golden hour or evening lighting, posed full-body shot

10. **Hotel Room Before Event** - Hotel mirror full-length selfie, getting ready for event, hotel room visible in background, good lighting, confident pose

CRITICAL AUTHENTICITY ELEMENTS:
- Smartphone camera quality (iPhone/Android), NOT professional DSLR
- Natural grain, slight blur, realistic phone camera artifacts
- Varied angles - some slightly off-center, not perfectly composed
- Different times of day and lighting conditions
- Mix of flash and no-flash photos
- Real backgrounds - clubs, homes, restaurants, venues (not studios)
- Diverse women - different ethnicities (Latina, Black, White, Asian, Middle Eastern), ages 21-35, body types
- Natural expressions - genuine smiles, confidence, having fun
- Casual accessories - phones, drinks, clutches visible when appropriate
- Slight imperfections - realistic makeup, natural poses, authentic moments

COLLAGE LAYOUT:
- Arrange in a clear 2x5 or 3-3-3-1 grid layout
- Leave small white borders between images for easy cropping
- Each image should be distinct and clearly separated
- Square or rectangular format that works well for cropping individual images

STYLE REFERENCE:
Think: Real customer Instagram posts, tagged photos on social media, authentic testimonial submissions, NOT polished influencer content or professional product photography. These should look like real women who bought the dress and are excited to share photos.

AVOID:
- Studio backgrounds or professional lighting setups
- Overly perfect composition or poses
- Professional model looks (too polished)
- Stock photo aesthetics
- All photos looking too similar
- Professional photography quality
- Any images that scream "AI generated" or "fake"

GOAL: Create images that could be mistaken for real customer submissions on a fashion brand's Instagram or website testimonials section.
